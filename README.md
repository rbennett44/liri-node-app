# liri-node-app
The Liri Node App, or LIRI-BOT, is a language interpretation and recognition interface that runs from the command line, takes in parameters from the user and returns data based on those parameters.  In order to function properly, it is linked with Spotify for songs, and OMDB for movies. 

The project required node and npm packages and was written in javascript.  It utilizes gitignore and .env files as well as fs packages to read appended files. 

##How the App Works

First, the user will need to go to this project in their terminal and download npm install. Next there are three commands the user can enter to get a response.  First, enter "node liri.js" and then one of the following: 

1. 'spotify-this-song'
2. 'movie-this'
3. 'do-what-it-says'

##Spotify-This-Song
Here, I began by navigating to the project, and typing in "node liri.js spotify-this-song 'flares'".
